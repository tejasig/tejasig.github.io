    <p>
      Developed a Python-based computational pipeline to construct and analyse
      graph representations of biomolecular assemblies derived from structural
      (PDB) data. Implemented distance-based interaction modelling, adjacency
      construction, and network-theoretic analysis to investigate structural
      organisation in biomolecular complexes.
