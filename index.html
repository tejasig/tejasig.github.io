      <p>
        I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Chemistry at St. Stephen’s College,
        University of Delhi, and I am drawn to questions about how biomolecules are organised and interact
        with one another. I am particularly interested in using computational tools to explore the structure
        hidden within complex systems, in a way that remains physically and chemically meaningful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Working with biomolecular data has often involved translating physical systems into graph-based
        representations, where relationships between components can be studied systematically. This has
        led me to develop Python-based analysis pipelines to process biomolecular structural data, construct
        graph-based representations, and explore patterns that are not immediately visible from raw molecular
        coordinates. I have also been engaging with molecular dynamics simulations as a way to connect
        structural organisation with underlying physical motion and interactions at the atomic scale.
        Through this work, I have had to make explicit choices about connectivity, representation, and
        modelling assumptions, which has made questions of interpretability central to how I analyse results
        and draw conclusions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Building these pipelines step by step has been an important part of how I learn, as it highlights
        both the strengths and limitations of different modelling choices. Alongside this, I have come to
        appreciate the role of mathematics and physics in shaping how problems in chemistry and biology are
        framed, and in clarifying the assumptions underlying computational approaches.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am broadly interested in computational biophysics and molecular modelling, particularly in areas
        where ideas from physics, chemistry, and mathematics intersect. This page is a brief reflection of
        what I am currently exploring and the way I like to think about scientific work.
