      <p>
        I am interested in using computational tools to understand how biomolecules are organised and interact with one another.
        What draws me most is the structure hidden within complex systems, and the challenge of finding clear ways to represent
        and analyse that structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Working with biomolecular data has often involved translating physical systems into graph-based representations, where
        relationships between components can be studied systematically. This has led to the development of Python-based analysis
        pipelines that process structural information, construct meaningful representations, and explore patterns that are not
        immediately visible from raw molecular coordinates. Through this process, careful attention to connectivity, modelling
        choices, and interpretability has become central to how conclusions are drawn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Building analysis pipelines step by step has been an important part of learning, as it highlights both the strengths and
        limitations of the methods being used. Alongside this, there is a growing appreciation for the role of mathematics and
        physics in shaping how problems in chemistry and biology are framed, from model construction to interpretation. Viewing
        chemical and biological systems through these lenses has helped clarify assumptions, approximations, and underlying structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am broadly interested in computational biophysics and molecular modelling, particularly in areas where ideas from physics,
        chemistry, and mathematics intersect. This page is a brief reflection of what I am currently exploring and the way I like to
        think about scientific work.
